## What is BIQL?

BIDS Query Language (BIQL) is a domain-specific query language designed for the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). It provides a familiar SQL-like syntax for finding, filtering, and analyzing neuroimaging datasets with unprecedented ease and power.

```sql
-- Find all functional scans from specific subjects
SELECT sub, ses, task, run, filepath
WHERE datatype=func AND sub IN [01, 02, 03]
ORDER BY sub, run

-- Get QSM reconstruction groups with file lists
SELECT filename, sub, ses, acq, COUNT(*) as total_files
WHERE (part=mag OR part=phase) AND suffix=MEGRE
GROUP BY sub, ses, acq
```

## Key Features

üîç **Intuitive Syntax** - SQL-like queries that feel natural to researchers and developers

üìä **Powerful Aggregation** - GROUP BY with auto-aggregated file lists for reconstruction workflows

üéØ **Smart Pattern Matching** - Wildcard and regex support for flexible file discovery

‚ö° **High Performance** - Optimized for large datasets with thousands of files

üß† **BIDS Native** - Deep understanding of BIDS entities, metadata, and participant data

üîß **Multiple Output Formats** - JSON, CSV, TSV, table, and paths output

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install BIQL
pip install biql

# Query your BIDS dataset
biql --dataset /path/to/bids "SELECT DISTINCT task WHERE datatype=func"

# Get QSM reconstruction groups
biql "SELECT sub, acq, COUNT(*) WHERE part=mag GROUP BY sub, acq" \
     --format table --dataset /data/qsm_study
```

## Use Cases

- **Dataset Exploration** - Quickly understand what data you have
- **Quality Control** - Find missing files or inconsistent naming
- **Processing Pipelines** - Generate file lists for batch processing
- **QSM Workflows** - Group magnitude/phase pairs for reconstruction
- **Metadata Analysis** - Query acquisition parameters and demographics
- **File Discovery** - Complex searches across large multi-site studies
